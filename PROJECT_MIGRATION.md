# Project Migration Documentation

## Overview
This document details the process of migrating the Mima e-commerce project from a subfolder (`repo-asker-14/`) to the root directory and pushing it to GitHub to replace the existing repository.

## Migration Journey

### Step 1: Moving Files to Root Directory
**Problem:** The entire project was located in a subfolder `repo-asker-14/` instead of the root directory.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Move all files from repo-asker-14 to root
mv repo-asker-14/* .
mv repo-asker-14/.[!.]* . 2>/dev/null || true

# Remove the empty folder
rm -rf repo-asker-14
```

**Result:** All project files (src/, public/, supabase/, package.json, etc.) were successfully moved to the root directory.

### Step 2: Reinstalling Dependencies
**Problem:** After moving files, the development server failed with `vite: not found` error because node_modules was not properly set up in the root directory.

**Solution:**
```bash
npm install
```

**Result:** Successfully reinstalled 619 packages. The Vite build tool and all dependencies were now available.

### Step 3: Updating Workflow Configuration
**Problem:** The development workflow was still configured to run from the old `repo-asker-14` directory.

**Solution:**
- Removed the old workflow configuration
- Created a new workflow pointing to the root directory
- Command: `npm run dev`
- Port: 5000
- Output type: webview

**Result:** Development server successfully started on http://localhost:5000

### Step 4: Pushing to GitHub (Multiple Challenges)

#### Challenge 1: Git Remote Configuration Conflicts
**Problem:** Initial attempts to add the GitHub remote failed with:
```
fatal: could not set 'remote.origin.url' to 'https://github.com/yonetoussaint/repo-asker-14.git'
```

**Attempted Solutions:**
1. Tried `git remote add origin` - Failed (remote already existed with issues)
2. Tried `git remote set-url origin` - Failed (remote didn't exist properly)
3. Tried `git remote remove origin` - Showed "No such remote 'origin'"

**Resolution:** Successfully removed any remnants and started fresh.

#### Challenge 2: Git Lock File Issue
**Problem:** When trying to add the remote, got error:
```
error: could not lock config file .git/config: File exists
```

**Root Cause:** A previous git operation didn't complete properly, leaving a lock file.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Remove the lock file
rm -f .git/config.lock

# Then add the remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/yonetoussaint/repo-asker-14.git
```

**Result:** Successfully added the remote.

#### Challenge 3: Authentication
**Problem:** GitHub no longer accepts password authentication for git operations (deprecated since August 2021).

**Solution:** Use Personal Access Token (PAT)
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Generate new token with 'repo' scope
3. Use the token as password when pushing

### Final Push Commands
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Replace repo with new project structure"
git push -u origin main --force
```

**When prompted:**
- Username: GitHub username
- Password: Personal Access Token (not GitHub password)

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Git Lock Files:** Lock files (`.git/config.lock`, `.git/index.lock`) can prevent git operations. They're safe to remove when no other git commands are running.

2. **GitHub Authentication:** Modern GitHub requires Personal Access Tokens (PAT) or SSH keys, not passwords.

3. **Project Structure:** Always ensure the project root contains the main configuration files (package.json, vite.config.ts, etc.) for workflows to function properly.

4. **Dependency Installation:** After moving files, always reinstall dependencies to ensure proper setup in the new location.

5. **Workflow Configuration:** Update workflow settings when changing project structure.
